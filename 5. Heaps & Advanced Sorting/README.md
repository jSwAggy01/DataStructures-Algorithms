# Heaps in Data Structures

## Introduction
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, making it efficient for priority queue operations. Heaps are commonly used in algorithms for tasks such as sorting, scheduling, and graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

## Types of Heaps

### 1. Max-Heap
- In a max-heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- The maximum value is at the root.

### 2. Min-Heap
- In a min-heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
- The minimum value is at the root.

## Basic Operations

### 1. Insertion
- Adding an element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.

### 2. Deletion
- Removing the maximum (in a max-heap) or minimum (in a min-heap) element from the heap while maintaining the heap property.

### 3. Heapify
- Converting an array of elements into a valid heap structure.

### 4. Peek (or Top)
- Viewing the maximum (in a max-heap) or minimum (in a min-heap) element without removing it.

## Example

```cpp
// C++ example of a max-heap implementation
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class MaxHeap {
private:
    std::vector<int> heap;

public:
    // Insert a value into the max-heap
    void insert(int value) {
        heap.push_back(value);
        int currentIndex = heap.size() - 1;
        int parentIndex = (currentIndex - 1) / 2;

        while (currentIndex > 0 && heap[currentIndex] > heap[parentIndex]) {
            std::swap(heap[currentIndex], heap[parentIndex]);
            currentIndex = parentIndex;
            parentIndex = (currentIndex - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

    // Remove and return the maximum value from the max-heap
    int extractMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Heap is empty");
        }

        int maxValue = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap.back();
        heap.pop_back();

        heapify(0);

        return maxValue;
    }

    // Heapify a subtree rooted at a given index
    void heapify(int index) {
        int leftChild = 2 * index + 1;
        int rightChild = 2 * index + 2;
        int largest = index;

        if (leftChild < heap.size() && heap[leftChild] > heap[largest]) {
            largest = leftChild;
        }

        if (rightChild < heap.size() && heap[rightChild] > heap[largest]) {
            largest = rightChild;
        }

        if (largest != index) {
            std::swap(heap[index], heap[largest]);
            heapify(largest);
        }
    }
};
```

## Conclusion

Heaps are essential data structures for maintaining priority queues efficiently. Understanding max-heaps and min-heaps and their operations is crucial for solving a wide range of problems that involve prioritizing and organizing data.

# Advanced Sorting Techniques in Algorithms

## Introduction
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science used for organizing data in a specific order. While basic sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort are simple to understand, advanced sorting techniques provide improved performance for large datasets. This README introduces some advanced sorting algorithms.

## Advanced Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Merge Sort
- Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is stable.

### 2. Quick Sort
- Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array into elements smaller and larger than the pivot.
- It has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and is widely used in practice.

### 3. Heap Sort
- Heap sort is an in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a max-heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
- It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is not stable.

### 4. Radix Sort
- Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
- It has a linear time complexity of O(nk) for n elements and k digits.

### 5. Tim Sort
- Tim sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.
- It is used in various programming languages and libraries, including Python's built-in `sorted()` function.

## Example

```cpp
// C++ example of merge sort
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void merge(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int middle, int right) {
    int n1 = middle - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - middle;

    std::vector<int> leftArr(n1);
    std::vector<int> rightArr(n2);

    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
        leftArr[i] = arr[left + i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
        rightArr[i] = arr[middle + 1 + i];
    }

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;

    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
            arr[k] = leftArr[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            arr[k] = rightArr[j];
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }

    while (i < n1) {
        arr[k] = leftArr[i];
        i++;
        k++;
    }

    while (j < n2) {
        arr[k] = rightArr[j];
        j++;
        k++;
    }
}

void mergeSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        int middle = left + (right - left) / 2;

        mergeSort(arr, left, middle);
        mergeSort(arr, middle + 1, right);

        merge(arr, left, middle, right);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Advanced sorting techniques provide efficient ways to sort data in various scenarios. Understanding these algorithms and their characteristics is essential for choosing the right sorting method for your specific needs.
